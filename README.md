# tribute-page-freecodecamp
Just another small project for educational purposes. 

Following along to the Responsive Web Design path of [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/). The objective of this project is to build a tribute page. 

Next steps could be...
- [x] make a new git branch and change the code so that it corresponds to the [user story](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) -> Can be also checked on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/kotcraps/pen/dyZZzJd)
- [ ] make the website responsive for mobile devices
- [ ] make a better design
